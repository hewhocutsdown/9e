# Title Ideas

* Nine Eyes

# Philosophy

* Have a simple base game
* Regularly come out with challenges that require approaching decks in new ways
* 9 "eyes" (aspects) + 0 and 10 (none/all). Base aspect is chosen between 1-9.

# Card Ideas
 * card for destroying infrastructure, like William of Orange, vs. Twitter and jihadists.
 * Black & Green (upwing/downwing)
 * Thank you for smoking
 * Burning of the library of Baghdad
 * Player Poker in Mexico
 * Post-Imperial
 * Salafism
 * War on General computing
 * Zero to oneWarlord (too generic)
 * Living Wills (Bear Stearns, Dodd-Frank)

# Errata
 * Baphomet: force toblock
 * Black Swan: Controls, not owns

# Things to Try

* Two-sided cards (flip cards over for present/past effects)
* Move quotes/etc to a third 'face' of the card.
* Make variant art available but for the same 'card'
* What is the elder game?
* Deck size minimum but not maximum?
* Parties: semi-overlapping with aspects?
* Make > 2 players the default base game: make collective action, etc, more salient.
* Make positive **and** negative loops more salient.
* If more than one card you control exits play this interval, you choose the order in which they enter the past.
* [this seems wrong] Card activations occur after any cards due to exit the present have done so.
* Playchain
* With the Playchain, you can literally have time-reversal mechanics.
* Begin aligned, at aspect?
* Character growth: level up, choose paths? (level 1 Netzach, level 3 Gevurah). Highest levels require exclusivity. Player levels up with influence.
* Stack predicaments
* Race against entropy; prisoner's dilemma (compare watering hole in evolution)
* Game win: staying in the game, morphing along the way as necessary (passive income, etc)
* Deal with deck of undrawn cards (scry, grind deck down, filter things out, fiddle with probability [zemblanity/serendipity])
* Binding contracts
* Full art, extra text for interest
* Pick one of three cards from shared deck (put one in hand, discard one)
* Buy the thing to prevent opponent from winning
* Challenge: you meet the conditions, you get the reward (influence), or all players get the reward (influence/capital)
* Like a D&D party?
* Each player has an end-game trigger that may/may not be public
* Each game is like a campaign.
* Someone can torpedo anonymously collective actions, promising aid but not following through
* Loyalty: buys actors, locks out others.
* Residual/passive income, every turn?
* Mixing aspects is discouraged but not disallowed? (rising cost?)
* Finite number of cards, scale with # of users?
* Strategies for short term victories, long term pain vs. long term that sucks in short term.
* Plot cards: 6 cards shuffled into core deck, relates to predicaments, etc. Game events triggering coalition formation/dissolution.
* Each player has a unique advantage. A player is removed from the game when a) they cannot draw any more cards and b) they have no actors in play and ? c) they are out of capital/influence
* Goal is to survive predicament deck (collective win) **or** outlast opponents.
* General goal is resilience, optionality
* Resolving challenges will equip you (and sometimes your opponents (language?)) to weather the effects of certain predicaments, either by negating an effect, offering a bonus, or redirecting an effect.
* Capital reserves may be negative
* Encourage ecological thinking
* "Memories": Returning cards from "out of play" to the past, to affect the present.
* Do I replenish my hand at end of turn?
* Font must support weird characters.
* alternate end condition: game ends at the third new moon?
* Shared history. Start play, draw four cards, then three cards, then two cards, then 1 card.
* Shared play past/future?
* Capital, by type, spend to play. Actors can help you gain capital. Your goal is the infinite game.... Passive income
* Late Capitalism (Battle Royale/Hunger Games); demands a 'last man standing', cutthroat approach.
* Some will be prisoner's dilemma type situations (think the Netrunner version of pledge 0, 1 or 2 credits), where cooperation wins, but defection wins asymmetrically.
* Demagogue: Can contend with actors once per turn.
* Scope measured in powers of 10. So scope zero = 1, scope 1 = 10, scope 2 = 100, etc.
* Strategy: draw up to six so that you can discard at end of turn directly to the past.
* Max handsize?
* How does the past affect the present
* Play occurs at each tempo?
* Compare with features/constraints of factions (black: destroy planeswalkers but not enchantments)
* Politicans: brief chaos, reset to status quo; affects present from future.
* CEOs: sustained influence
* Invest into technique: withdraw later (think Netrunner)
* Future stack automatically resolves *first*, counts as a player.

# Problems To Work On

* Replace 'grade' with the term 'aspect'
* Replace interval terminology with 'phase' and go with full/half/quarter/new (as in moon)
* Fix malchut: Yellow top, olive green right, red russet let, black
* Replace English sephirot with Hebrew

# Proposed sets

 * Nine Eyes [Base]
  * 250 or 300 cards (or should it be 100 unique, x 3 copies?)
  * Update packs: 20 new unique cards.
 * #22C
 * Temporary Autonomous Zones
 * X-Risk
 * Plutocratic Insurgency
