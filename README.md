Anthony Di Franco:
	I think the strengths are:
	Hearthstone: simple baseline for combat and rules
	Chromancer: Color and resource / casting system, place system, reified deck, graveyard, mana pool
	Shadowfist: place system, flavor
	Dominion: economy, draft mechanic

Each card has:

 - a tempo
 - a type
 - a duration/window, where relevant
 - a scope, where relevant
 - a theme, where relevant
 - a faction, where relevant
 - an Enneagram number/color
